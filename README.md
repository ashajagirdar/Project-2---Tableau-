What dental pharma wanted was initially more data visualisations that could help them measure current and future performance.

-The initial objective for this project was to create a dashboard for Dental Pharma that met their business requirements.
- After the dashboard was created, report back on the process by creating a presentation to present to the Stakeholders.
